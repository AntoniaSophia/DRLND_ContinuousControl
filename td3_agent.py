# TD3 = Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3)
# 
# Addressing Function Approximation Error in Actor-Critic Methods
# https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09477
# 
# TD3 description is taken from:
# https://towardsdatascience.com/td3-learning-to-run-with-ai-40dfc512f93
# 
# The base for implementation is taken from:
# https://github.com/prasoonkottarathil/Twin-Delayed-DDPG-TD3-/blob/master/TD3.ipynb
#
# TD3 is the successor to the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient 
# (DDPG)(Lillicrap et al, 2016). 
# Up until recently, DDPG was one of the most used algorithms 
# for continuous control problems such as robotics and autonomous driving. 
# Although DDPG is capable of providing excellent results, it has its drawbacks. 
# Like many RL algorithms training DDPG can be unstable and heavily reliant on 
# finding the correct hyper parameters for the current task (OpenAI Spinning Up, 2018).
# This is caused by the algorithm continuously over estimating the Q values of 
# the critic (value) network. These estimation errors build up over time and 
# can lead to the agent falling into a local optima or experience catastrophic 
# forgetting. TD3 addresses this issue by focusing on reducing the overestimation 
# bias seen in previous algorithms. This is done with the addition of 3 key features:
#    - Using a pair of critic networks (The twin part of the title)
#    - Delayed updates of the actor (The delayed part)
#    - Action noise regularisation (This part didn’t make it to the title :/ )
